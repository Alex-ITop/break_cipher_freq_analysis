I am a student. I am a prospective teacher of biology. One of my hobbies is the English language. It is the most popular language on earth. Many people learn in order to build a successful career or find friends abroad. As for me, I find this language one of the most beautiful in the world. That's why I decided to learn it. I like to listen to English songs. I am glad that I can understand what some song is about without anybody's help.

I started to learn English at school and now I continue to learn it at the university. I often stay at the university after classes, because I am a member Ð¾f a research group. I like research work, that's why I often search for new information Most of the articles of foreign colleagues are in English. New ideas in science happen so quickly, that it is impossible to translate everything into different languages at once. But I think it is very important to learn about new ideas as quickly as possible.

My dream is to visit one of the English-speaking countries. I would like to communicate with its people and learn something new about its culture. But now I have some friends abroad. I can send letters to them via the Internet. Most of them are also students. We often discuss our plans for the future. I think young people are very much alike all over the world. And it is very interesting to learn a foreign language and be able to understand it.
